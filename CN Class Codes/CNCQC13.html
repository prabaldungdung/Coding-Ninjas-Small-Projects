            <h2>#SWITCHTOCODE</h2> <h1>Best Coding Practices for Hassle-free Programming</h1>
            <p>Programmers find innovative ways to recreate these languages for different purposes. Thus, some static dos and donts are always of use in the fluid zone called coding. Normally, a great code has three common features: maintainability, dependability, and usability. It should also be adaptable enough to be efficient even in changing environments. However, before coding even begins, a few prerequisites need to be fulfilled in order to provide a solid foundation on which readable code can be written.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>PREREQUISITES</h2>
            <p>This is easily the most important step of all. In absence of these, a code may be inefficient even if it is completed. The prerequisites that need to be in place for an efficient code covers matters like design and architecture. An important question is how development is structured. What is the specific purpose of the software? The problem that the code is meant to solve must be clear to the developer. What is the design of the individual components? Such basic requirements have to be fulfilled when a good code is being written.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>COMMENTING</h2>
            <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are written by multiple programmers. However, comments reduce the cost of knowledge transfer.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>GOOD NAMING CONVENTIONS</h2>
            <p>Using good naming conventions is the next step to good coding. Often developers use Y1 or XI as variables, and then do not replace them with meaningful names.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>SIMPLICITY AND COMPACTNESS</h2>
            <p>The key to a good code is also simplicity. To achieve a certain result, developers may use complex logic but this should be minimised while writing a good code. The next developer who uses the code may use it for a different purpose and may not even completely understand or utilise the complex logic.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <h2>PORTABILITY</h2>
            <p>Another feature of a good code is portability. If the code contains values referring to absolute parameters such as file names, URLs. or IP addresses, it will not run on a host that is of a different design.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>TESTING</h2>
            <p>Testing is also a necessary part in the process of coding. Test cases must be planned while the code is being written, and they are developed while an application is coded.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>DEBUGGING THE CODE</h2>
            <p>While writing a code, it is necessary to check for errors throughout. Though it is fine for smaller programs to be debugged after they have been written, this becomes a bottleneck for longer programmes.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>DEPLOYMENT</h2>
            <p>Once the code has been written, it has to be deployed. The installation files should be kept to a minimum and updated regularly.</p>

      Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ[a]; derived from a shortening of
      English animation) is a hand-drawn and computer-generated animation
      originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers
      specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, anime, in Japan
      and in Japanese, describes all animated works, regardless of style or
      origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation
      are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes
      and art styles that are sometimes labelled as anime.

      The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic
      art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka
      and spread in the following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
      Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly
      to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime
      are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video
      games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and
      niche audiences.[2]

      Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have
      adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art,
      characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
      individualistic techniques.[3] Compared to Western animation, anime
      production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of
      settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle
      shots.[3] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and
      features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being
      large and emotive eyes.[4]
